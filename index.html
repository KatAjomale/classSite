            The 2 important parts to capturing a photograph â€“ the subject and the location. <em><strong>At Arrow Photography we know how to emphasise

    <h3>Adele and John's Wedding</h3>


        <p>
          Adele and John wanted some wedding photos of just themselves around Sydney Harbour with the <strong>Sydney Opera
          House</strong>, Botanical Gardens and <strong>Sydney Harbour Bridge</strong> as the backdrop. We met up with them one sunny afternoon on the Sydney Opera
          House steps and spent some time capturing some greats shots of them both in these awe-inspiring locations. After shooting in front
          of the Opera House and Bridge, we walked into Sydney's <strong>Botanical Gardens</strong> with the city behind them and captured some great natural
          moments between the two of them. After a glass or two of Champagne, we wandered through the gardens to Mrs Macquaries Point and
          photographed the bride and groom with the iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge behind them.

    <h3>Jane and Richard's Wedding</h3>


        <p>
            Jane and Richard's wedding was at St. Wilfrid's Church, Calverley and the wedding reception took place at
            the Mercure Parkway Hotel Leeds. All the groomsmen were in kilts as the groom is Scottish and there was definitely a Scottish theme
            to the day. After the ceremony we were lucky enough for some sunshine to come out just at the right moment so the bride and groom
            could have the roof down on the wedding car. We worked quickly in the short time we had sun to capture some great photos of the bride
            and groom through the trees with the sunshine behind outside the Mercure Parkway Hotel. The wedding speeches had everyone in stitches
            as the best man had prepared a slide-show of photos from the stag do!
